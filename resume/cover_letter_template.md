Dear {{ company_name or "Hiring Manager" }},

I am excited to apply for the {{ job_title or "role" }} at {{ company_name or "your company" }}. With over 8 years across revenue accounting, audit, and tax, I lead ASC 606 revenue processes, streamline month-end close, and deliver accurate GAAP/IFRS reporting.

- Experience aligned to your needs: {{ matched_keywords|join(", ") if matched_keywords else "accounting fundamentals, reconciliations, audit support" }}  
- Tools: {{ tools_hit|join(", ") if tools_hit else "NetSuite, Dynamics, QuickBooks, Looker, Google Sheets" }}
